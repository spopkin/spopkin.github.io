				<h2>This Website as a Project</h2>
				<p>While creating this website has not been particularly difficult from a technical standpoint, it still involved a fair amount of writing, as well as the use of HTML and CSS.  As such, I would argue that it counts as a small project.</p>
				
				<h2>List of Technologies Used:</h2>
				<ul class="TechList">
					<li>HTML 5</li>	
					<li>CSS 3</li>	
					<li>Git / GitHub</li>	
				</ul>

				<h2>How it Works</h2>
				<p>It is a simple set of HTML and CSS documents hosted using GitHub Pages.</p>

				<h2>Design Decisions</h2>
				<ul class="TechList">
					<li>It makes use of a high-contrast, minimalist theme to maximize readability and minimize clutter.  This also makes the pages load faster.</li>  
					<li>Internal Navigation links are always visible, so as to maximize usability.</li>
					<li>Iframes are used to allow code reuse.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Why Do It?</h2>
				<p>I wanted a site with a simple layout on which I could showcase my personal projects.</p>
