			<h4>My Technical Background</h4>
			<p>As a recent graduate of NC State, I have a background that is heavy in Java and Object-Oriented design.  I have been using Java in my coursework since my Freshman year and also used it in my second internship.  I have also used JUnit to test my code in more or less every Java-based course since my Sophomore year and have also had some exposure to Spring boot as a means to quickly spin up REST APIs.</p>

			<p>In addition to my Java experience, I am reasonably good with SQL.  I learned it in my first internship and have since used it in two of my courses to complete class projects. These included one with requirements regarding database normalization.</p>
			
			<p>I also like using Python, C, C++, and JavaScript.  I learned C and C++ as part of my coursework and actually taught myself Python and JavaScript.</p>

			<p>Ultimately, my background is in my education and internships.  My education has involved a number of theory-heavy courses, as well as project-heavy courses.</p>

			<p>Thus far, I have had three internships.  The first was with SQL Sentry in Huntersville, NC.  The second one was with Interactive Intelligence in RTP.  My third and final internship was with the Administrative Office of the Courts in Raleigh.  Across these, I have done work involving Java, databases, scripting, Object-oriented development, and Linux system administration.</p>
