# My Projects

[Back to My Main Page](index.html)

My projects can largely be divided into three categories.  These are work-related projects, school-related projects, and personal projects.  Projects from school assignments and from my internships will be at the bottom of this page, while personal projects will be at the top.

## Personal Projects

### PDF Rulefinder

### [ASM Roller and JavaScript Dice Roller](dice-rollers.html)

### This Website

While this website is a simple set of pages written in Markdown and hosted on Github Pages, it is arguably an example of a writing project and is on my Github, so I would argue that it counts.
