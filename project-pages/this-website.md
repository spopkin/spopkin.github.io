<h2>This Website as a Project</h2>
hile creating this website has not been particularly difficult from a technical standpoint, it still involved a fair amount of writing, as well as the use of HTML and CSS.  As such, I would argue that it counts as a small project.

I later went on to start changing things over to Jekyll for better code reuse across the site.
