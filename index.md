## About Myself and this Site

Welcome to my site.  I am a recent graduate and aspiring software engineer who has numerous ideas for personal projects.  As such, I often work on them.  This site primarily exists as a place for me to showcase those projects.  If you are interested in reading about various pieces of software that I have written, then you have come to the right place.

To read about my projects, please visit my [projects](projects.html) page.

If you are looking to reach out to me, my contact information can be found on my [contact information page](contact.html).
