## About Me

I am a recent NC State computer science graduate and aspiring software developer with intestests in a variety of software topics.

## My Background

I recently graduated from NC State university's computer science program (cum laude).  As a recent NC State computer science graduate, I have been exposed to a number of technologies including object-oriented programming, relational database management systems, and Linux.  Out of all of the technologies that I have been exposed to, object-oriented development in Java on Linux is my strongest combination, though I also enjoy using Python, SQL, and C.

In addition to my education, I have had three internships.  Two were in software development and engineering type roles, while one was in a Linux systems administrator type of role.  In my internships, I have had opportunities to make use of Python, Java, Powershell, SQL, and a number of other technologies.

## My Projects

I have worked on a number of projects, including a few that I have done in my spare time.  All of these can be found on my [projects.html](projects page).
