## About Myself and this Site

Welcome to my site.  I am a recent graduate and aspiring software engineer who has numerous ideas for personal projects.  As such, I often work on them.  This site primarily exists as a place for me to showcase those projects.  If you are interested in reading about various pieces of software that I have written, then you have come to the right place.

To read about my projects, please visit my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page.

That said, I am currently job hunting, so if you are looking for a developer, please feel free to contact me.  You can get my contact information from my <a href="contact.html">contact information</a> page.

Please note that this site is presently undergoing construction, as I have decided to switch over to Jekyll so that I can reuse the navigation bar code, rather than having to use JavaScript to display the html for it or having to copy it into every new page.
