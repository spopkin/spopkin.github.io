								<h4>My Background - Overview</h4>
								<p>As a recent NC State computer science graduate (cum laude) who has had three internships, my education and internships most prepare me for software development roles.  I have been developing in Java since my Freshman year, though I have also learned a number of other technologies through my internships and personal projects.</p>
