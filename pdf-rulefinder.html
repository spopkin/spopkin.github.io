				<h2>PDF RuleFinder</h2>
				<p>The PDF RuleFinder is a simple Node.js-based utility that is used to find the page in a set of pdf files that best matches a set of keywords.  It is the first non-trivial utility in my Dungeon-Master-Utility set, though it is not strictly limited to tabletop gaming use.  I actually tested it using technical manuals after I realized that I do not actually have any PDF files containing tabletop game rules.</p>

				<p>In short, it is a tool for searching through several PDF files at once to try to help the user find where to re-visit information.</p>
				
				<h2>List of Technologies and Techniques Used:</h2>
				<ul class="TechList">
					<li>HTML 5</li>	
					<li>CSS 3</li>	
					<li>Node.js</li>	
					<li>JavaScript</li>	
					<li>JQuery</li>	
					<li>MongoDB</li>	
					<li>REST</li>	
					<li>Express</li>	
					<li>pdf-text-extract library</li>	
					<li>Wait.for fibers library</li>	
				</ul>

				<h2>How it Works</h2>
				<p>When started with the --refresh-db flag, it uses pdf-text-extract to extract the text from all of the PDF files in a preconfigured rulebook directory.  After the text is extracted, it is inserted into entries for each given book in MongoDB.  Later, when the function to search is invoked, it searches through those extracted text entries and ranks them in terms of which page is the most likely to correspond to the searched-for keywords.</p>

				<p>The frontend is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript page that uses JQuery to retrieve information from the NodeJS REST API.</p>

				<h2>Design Decisions</h2>
				<ul class="TechList">
					<li>It is a Node.js webapp to simplify future integration</li>  
					<li>It uses MongoDB, as the data used is just a bunch of documents</li>
					<li>It preloads the text data for performance reasons</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Why Do It?</h2>
				<p>I plan to get back into playing Dungeons and Dragons at some point.  When I do, I will want to build my own campaign.  That is a complex process that I would like to streamline.  Creating a working DM's toolkit is one potentially effective means to do so.</p>
