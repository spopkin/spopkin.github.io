## About Myself and This Site
I am a recent NC State computer science graduate with a broad variety of technical interests and topics to which I have been exposed.  Currently, object-oriented development using Java is what I am best at, though I also enjoy using Python, SQL, and other technologies.

I also sometimes work on personal projects to sharpen my technical skills.  To learn more, please head over to my <a href="projects.html" class="InLineLink">projects</a> page.

This site is essentially a portfolio site in which I can showcase some of my personal projects and occasionally throw in a self-reference guide or two.
