# My Projects

[Back to My Main Page](index.html)

My projects can largely be divided into three categories.  These are work-related projects, school-related projects, and personal projects.  This page will mostly cover personal projects, though some coursework and internship work may be discussed towards the end.

# Personal Projects

Projects in this category are ones that I did to learn a new technology, to have the end-product avaliable to me, or just for fun.
